Nego
==

This is an implementation of the Nego board game designed by
[Yuka Morii](http://www.yuka-design.com). The [rules](doc/nego-rule.pdf)
are included in the product description on [Koncent](https://koncent.jp/view/item/000000001904).


This builds on minimax-rs which provides minimax and MCTS style searches.

There are some gaps in the rules sheet addressed in the [QUESTIONS](doc/QUESTIONS.md) doc.

The implementation is pretty rough right now.
