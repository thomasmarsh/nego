Nego
==

This is an implementation of the Nego board game designed by Yuka Morii. The
[rules](https://koncent.net/00/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nego-rule.pdf) are
included in the product description on [Koncent](https://koncent.jp/view/item/000000001904).


This builds on minimax-rs which provide minimax and MCTS style searches.

There are some gaps in the rules sheet addressed in the [QUESTIONS](QUESTIONS.md) doc.

The implementation is pretty rough right now.
