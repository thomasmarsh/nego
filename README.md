Nego
==

[![Rust](https://github.com/thomasmarsh/nego/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/thomasmarsh/nego/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

This is an implementation of the Nego board game designed by
[Yuka Morii](http://www.yuka-design.com). The [rules](doc/nego-rule.pdf)
are included in the product description on [Koncent](https://koncent.jp/view/item/000000001904).

This builds on my separate [MCTS](https://github.com/thomasmarsh/mcts) (Monte Carlo Tree Search) library.

There are some gaps in the rules sheet addressed in the
[QUESTIONS](doc/QUESTIONS.md) doc.

The implementation is just proof of concept quality, but still fairly fast (and plays better than I do).
